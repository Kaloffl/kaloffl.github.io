        <p>
Whoops, I meant to post this article quite soon after the first one about the random_float() function.
I even wrote 90% of it, but then just left it lying around for almost one and a half years.
So here it finally is.
        </p>
        <p>
Continuing from <a target="_blank" href="0001.html">my first article</a>, the next logical step is to go from the range [0 .. 1) to an arbitrary range [min .. max).
Though here it is much less clear to me, if that interval should be closed or open and at which side.
Maybe it would make sens to treat the first argument as the closed and the second as the open side and impose no min-max ordering.
Most other implementations I saw treat the min as inclusive and the max as exclusive.
But most implementations are also technically incorrect, so there's that.
For simplicity, I'll begin with an both-inclusive algorithm for [min .. max] and discuss later how to change that.
Now let's first look at what is usually done.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>It doesn't work but it's fast!</h3>
        <p>
Well, that heading might be a bit of an overstatement, because in reality, the naive way I'll be describing here work well enough in most cases.
It does, however, bring with it a tiny amount of bias.
Not enough to matter in most applications, but for example in a long-running monte-carlo integration, it can add up.
So what is this horribly shameful way of calculating a random number? Here it is:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
float absolutely_broken_random_float(float min, float max, RandomState& state)
{
  return random_float(state) * (max - min) + min;
}
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
You have probably seen this before, because pretty much every implementation does exactly that <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/latest-doxygen/a00446_source.html#l01823" target="_blank">[0]</a><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/c319a7b2e4eb302b9abe9427079e669bf38ad6f8/stl/inc/random#L2666" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
But if we use it for a range that doesn't happen to align with the way floats work, for example [0 .. 100), we get this:

Which shows that some float outputs appear twice.
This isn't great, because this function is deterministic and will always double up the same numbers, so this rounding error is never resolved.
In fact, while I've iterated over 16,777,215 possible values for this table, there are only 15,456,010 distinct outputs.

        <h3>The birds and the buckets</h3>
        <p>
This problem stems from a mismatch between the input range (what <code>random_foat()</code> returns: 16,777,215 unique, evenly spaced values) and the expected output given via the min and max parameters.
Imagine dividing the cost of lunch ending in 11 cents between 5 colleagues.
There is no way to fairly divide it, and some will have to give a cent more than others.
Under colleagues you might keep track and average this out over time, but this function is too simple to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
One (the?) solution is to shrink the input range by rejecting values until it is a multiple of the output range.
Professor O'Neill has already written about and compared algorithms for this, so I'll refer you to <a href="https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bounded-rands.html" target="_blank">her post</a>.
For the rest of this article, I'll assume, that we already have a <code>random_int32(min, max)</code> function that is unbiased.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Anchoring the floats</h3>
        <p>
Just like last time, I want to treat the floating-point output more like fixed-point with constant distances between the possible values.
Now that negative numbers are also possible, there are cases with 2<sup>25</sup> possible outputs, for example [-1 .. 1).
And if we want to have [-1 .. 1], we can even fit 2<sup>25</sup>+1 values with even spacing!
Thanks to the nature of floats, the same is true for [-2 .. 2), [-4 .. 4), and so on.
        </p>
        <figure>

-1                             -1/2            -1/4    -1/8   1/8     1/4             1/2                              1
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
If the distance between values is fixed to the coarsest resolution in the whole range, it is possible for the other end of the range to not align with that.
For example, the range [1 .. 2<sup>33</sup>) will have a step size of 2<sup>33-24</sup> = 512, with one value at 0 and the next higher one at 512, we can never get a value of 1.
This is probably not the end of the world, but is something to keep in mind when using this function.
The question now is, whether the lower end of this range should be rounded to nearest (0) or into the range (512), I'll be doing the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
As mentioned above, we can get up to 2<sup>25</sup>+1 values if we have a negative min and positive max.
That settles the Pi vs Tau debate at least for this algorithm, because when generating a random, unbiased angle with the algorithm developed here, the range [-Pi .. Pi) will have twice the resolution compared to [0 .. Tau).
        </p>
        <p>
To get the step size, I used the function <code>nextafter</code>, which gives the next representable floating-point value either up or downwards.
Subtracting the next value from the current one gives the step size, doing it for both ends and taking the max gives the coarsest step size.
This step is quite expensive though, so if you know a better way to achieve this, let me know.
        </p>
        <p>
<b>Addendum:</b>
Since writing this part I've found out that <code>nextafter</code> can be achieved by treating the float bits as an integer and adding or subtracting one.
It's actually quite beautiful how the carry from the mantissa correctly affects the exponent.
I guess the will be a part 3 in this series in about one and a half years about this.
In the meantime I heavily recommend <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/04/21/exceptional-floating-point/" target="_blank">Bruce Dawson's</a> series about floats, as well as <a href="https://blog.m-ou.se/floats/" target="_blank">Mara's</a> post that reminded me of this fact.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>The final stretch(es)</h3>
        <p>
With the step size known, we can divide the upper and lower bounds of the range by it, which effectively changes the step size into 1 while preserving the number of values.
What else has a step size of 1? Integers!
What does the unbiased, arbitrary range <code>random_int32(min, max)</code> function need? Integers!
So at this point we just convert the divided bound values to actual 32-bit integers, pass them into the function and get out a random number.
Because this number can't be larger than 2<sup>24</sup> or smaller than -(2<sup>24</sup>), it can be converted back to a float without a problem.
Now one multiplication with the step size and we're back in the original bounds, with no rounding and no bias.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The code</h3>
        <p>
So here is everything discussed above tied together into a nice little function.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // std::max
#include &lt;cmath&gt;     // std::nextafter, std::ceil, std::floor
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;   // int32_t

float random_float(float min, float max, RandomState& state)
{
  float d0 = std::nextafter(min, max) - min;
  float d1 = max - std::nextafter(max, min);
  float max_delta = std::max(d0, d1);
  int32_t imin = (int32_t)std::ceil (min / max_delta);
  int32_t imax = (int32_t)std::floor(max / max_delta);
  return (float)random_int32(imin, imax, state) * max_delta;
}
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
Less nice is the performance of it: on a quick benchmark, it took 10 times as long to generate the same number of values as the biased float multiplication everyone is using.
One reason will be that sometimes the <code>random_int32</code> function will reject a value and re-generate a new one.
Another reason is, that the <code>nextafter</code>, conversions and divisions are also relatively expensive.
Some of that could be computed once and re-used, if the code is always generating random numbers in the same range, which is often the case.
Initial testing showed, that pre-calculated values could reduce the time to 2.3x of the naive method.
Unfortunately C++ doesn't allow floats as template parameters, so a hefty serving of hackering was required.
You could also hope for the compiler to inline the function and optimize it that way, so as always: measure measure measure!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
There certainly is some more optimization potential in this function, but what's much more important and still missing is a use-case where the difference in correctness can be appreciated.
I mentioned long-running monte-carlo integration above, for example path-tracing might benefit from this.
It'll also be a good real-world example to measure the performance difference.
And I've not even looked at the assembly output of this function. 
What terrible negligence!
