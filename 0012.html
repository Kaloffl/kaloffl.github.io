If you've ever worked with Quaternions and looked around the internet (or a physical library) for formulas to use with them, you might have noticed that some seem to work the opposite way than you had expected.
After checking the handedness of your coordinate systems and re-checking the formulas, you might have found other sources that claim to describe the same operation, but with a slightly different formula.
How can that be when everybody is claiming that Quaternions have no handedness (or chirality, which sounds much cooler but means the same).
        </p>
        <p>
Well, Quaternions have their own trouble with competing standards, and today we'll see why both standards are almost the same except for the order of two numbers.
In short: the two standards are usually called Hamiltonian and JPL.
The former one because it's the one that the father of Quaternions, William Rowan Hamilton, used when he published them.
The latter, because NASAs Jet Propulsion Lab preferred and advocated for them.

        <h3>The same but different</h3>
        <p>
Unfortunately, many publications that use Quaternions don't say which of the two they used, but there can be some hints.
For example the Hamiltonian rotation of a vector is <code>q*v/q</code>, while the JPL version is <code>q<sup>-1</sup>*v*q</code>, almost the same except for the order.
        </p>
        <p>
Another difference is in the definition of the Quaternion: for Hamiltonians it is just <code>i<sup>2</sup> = j<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> = ijk = -1</code>, which seems pretty neat.
For the JPL version on the other hand we have <code>i<sup>2</sup> = j<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup> = -1</code> and <code>ijk = 1</code> which requires two different numbers, how ugly!
We can take this apart a bit further and look at the multiplication tables for both:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
 Hamiltonian          JPL

 1 │ i  j  k      1 │ i  j  k
───┼─────────    ───┼─────────
 i │-1  k -j      i │-1 -k  j
 j │-k -1  i      j │ k -1 -i
 k │ j -i -1      k │-j  i -1
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
In the tables you can read off the result of multiplying the value on the left with the value on the top for each cell.
It might be notable that one is the transpose of the other.

        <h3>I can't not talk about Geometric Algebra</h3>
        <p>
In my <a target="_blank" href="0009.html">earlier post</a> about Quaternions, I used geometric algebra to create them as the result of multiplying two vectors together.
At some point I also mention these two standards and that I used the <code>ijk = 1</code> variant.
This was quite surprising to me when I first noticed, because I never consciously chose this version, it just arose from something I did.
And after some digging I found what this thing was and that I can blame <a target="_blank" href="https://bivector.net/tools.html">bivector.net</a> for it.
Or should I blame myself for copying their notation? Nah!
        </p>
        <p>
When you take a look at the linked site, you should see a large multiplication table, with the base bivectors <code>e<sub>12</sub> e<sub>31</sub> e<sub>23</sub></code>.
While I prefer to order them <code>e<sub>23</sub> e<sub>31</sub> e<sub>12</sub></code> because then they are in the same order as the axis they are each perpendicular to: <code>e<sub>1</sub> e<sub>2</sub> e<sub>3</sub></code>.
Although that isn't really important because the only order affects the result is that of a multiplication, which this isn't.
But you have to be careful which order of basis bivectors you chose as <code>i j k</code>, otherwise you get the wrong sign on accident while the rotation remains unaffected (another point in favor of my preferred order).
What's actually important is that they chose <code>e<sub>31</sub></code> instead of <code>e<sub>13</sub></code>, probably because it is more symmetric.
Or maybe they were already fans of JPL Quaternions, because this choice is what swaps between the two variants.
Let's look at more tables:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
 1   │ e23  e13  e12      1   │ e23  e31  e12 
─────┼───────────────    ─────┼───────────────
 e23 │-1    e12 -e13      e23 │-1   -e12  e31 
 e13 │-e12 -1    e23      e31 │ e12 -1   -e23 
 e12 │ e13 -e23 -1        e12 │-e31  e23 -1   

 e23*e13*e12 = -1         e23*e31*e12 =  1
 e12*e13*e23 =  1         e12*e31*e23 = -1

 I couldn't use subscripts because they're not monospace :(
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
So either switching between <code>e<sub>13</sub></code> and <code>e<sub>31</sub></code> or switching the order of multiplication will lead to a sign swap.
Though the latter does not affect the direction of rotation, because the only change is that we're actually calculating <code>kji</code> instead of <code>ijk</code>.
Something nice with the geometric algebra version is, that when you write something like <code>e<sub>31</sub></code> instead of <code>j</code>, you are communicating which standard you're using, so there's less confusion to be had.
