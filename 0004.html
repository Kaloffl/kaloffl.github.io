        <p>
Recently I wanted to replay Introversion Software's colorful cave climbing game <a href="https://www.introversion.co.uk/scannersombre/">Scanner Sombre</a>.
But when I tried launching the game it turned out that first some digging was in order, before I could start scanning:
the game started for a fraction of a second, not even displaying anything before it closed again.
This was quite surprising, as the game wasn't updated in years and I remembered playing it since then.
        </p>
        <p>
Now that the game apparently wasn't in the mood to run, the first step was to look for any log file that might shed some light on the situation.
Unfortunately the only log I found just stated that the game finished initializing its sound engine and then cuts off.
Not very helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
The next step was Windows' Event Viewer.
As expected, there were a few Errors in the past hour from my failed attempts to launch the game.
Looking through them, they all reported the game crashing due to an Access Violation.
So the game tried to read or write memory somewhere it is not allowed to, still not much to go on.
        </p>
        <p>
So far this investigation wasn't going great.
All I found out so far was that the game was actually crashing and not shutting down voluntarily.
It was time to get more serious and bust out the <a href="https://x64dbg.com/">debugger</a>.
Usually, I debug my own software with the luxury of debug builds and symbols.
This was a big (20MB!), optimized executable with no debug symbols.
Quite the change of scenery for me.
So let's just run it until the debugger catches the crash and go from there.

        <p>
Quite fitting that the debugger calls the Instruction Pointer "RIP" since this is where the program died.
Fortunately I have a vague idea what this <code>movaps</code> instruction does: it moves data between memory and a 128-bit register.
In this case it looks at the memory location stored in the <code>rax</code> register, minus <code>48<sub>hex</sub></code>, and tries to load 16 bytes into the 128-bit <code>xmm6</code> register.
So there must be some garbage address in <code>rax</code>, right?
Well, kind of.
The value in <code>rax</code> is <code>0000000011C8878C<sub>hex</sub></code>, which is the address to valid a memory location with read and write access.
But looking closer at the instruction, the 'a' in the mnemonic stands for 'aligned'.
This means, that the memory address must be 16-bit aligned, requiring the lowest 4 bits of the address to be 0.
However, we can easily see, that the address ends with <code>C<sub>hex</sub></code> which is <code>1100<sub>b</sub></code> in binary.
        </p>
        <p>
Okay, now we understand the immediate cause of the crash, now what?
Well luckily, there is another instruction called <code>movups</code> with an 'u' for 'unaligned'.
I guess the aligned version is faster and therefore preferred, but we don't care about performance right now, we care about not crashing.
And our luck isn't over: the instruction is encoded in the same number of bytes, so replacing it is dead simple.
So let's replace them and run the game again!

Well darn, looks like we weren't that lucky after all, now we crash just a few instructions later on the return instruction.
Having an access violation here can only mean that the program tries to jump to the wrong address, because someone has corrupted the stack or stack pointer (<code>rsp</code>).
So what is our stack right now?

        <p>
Yeah, that's not right.
But is that because somebody did some redecorating and painted over the stack memory, or is it the <code>rsp</code> register not actually pointing to the stack?
Well, we can already see in the disassembly, that the value in <code>rax</code> gets copied to <code>rsp</code>, but that isn't necessarily wrong, compilers love generating weird stuff like that.
But we already had problems with <code>rax</code> not being aligned, so let's look at the place where it gets its value from.

After scrolling up through the disassembly of a bunch of code doing something with SHA1 related instructions, we come to this <code>lea</code>.
The mnemonic stands for 'load effective address', even though it doesn't load anything.
Instead it is a very restrictive but short way to do integer multiplication and addition in one instruction.
In this case it appears to only do addition to the value in the <code>rsi</code> register and store the result in <code>rax</code>.
So the hunt continue, what's in <code>rsi</code>?

        <p>
Scrolling a bit farther up, we come to what looks like the typical start of a function: a bunch of <code>nop</code>s above and some <code>mov</code>s that push registers onto the stack.
If you go back to the <code>ret</code> you can see the code where they are popped back off the stack.
We also see that <code>rsi</code> is assigned the value from <code>rdi</code>, which is concerning:
We're at the start of a function and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170#parameter-passing">default calling convention for integer parameters on Windows on AMD64</a> is to put the first one into <code>rcx</code>, the second into <code>rdx</code>, third into <code>r8</code>, fourth into <code>r9</code> and any other onto the stack.
So what's happening here is, that the code somewhere along the way confuses a parameter, which is probably a pointer to an output buffer, with the pointer to the stack.
Programming mistake?
Compiler bug?
Undefined behavior?
Who knows!
        </p>
        <p>
Since I'm not convinced that is function is doing anything important anyway, I'm taking a stab in the dark and just <code>nop</code> out the <code>lea</code> where <code>rsi+40</code> is assigned to <code>rax</code>.
This should fix both problems we've encountered so far: <code>rax</code> is now correctly aligned for the <code>movaps</code> and the stack pointer will be restored to the correct value before returning.

And indeed, after removing this one instruction, the game launched as it should.
In fact I played through it entirely with no other issues.

But of course a few questions remain in the dark, waiting for somebody to descend to even deeper disassemblies and shine a light on things.
Why did it run before?
Whose code is this?
How do they render all these points?
What's the deal with those <code>movaps</code> anyway, they read values from memory that appear to never be used.
I hope to answer some of these questions an another post.
