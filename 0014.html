No, I'm not addicted to Quaternions.
I can stop whenever I want, I promise!
        </p>
        <p>
One way to create Quaternions that rotate a vector in a certain plane for a given angle is to use the Quaternion exponential with a "pure Quaternion", aka a Bi-vector multiplied with the angle, like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
<span>auto angle = random_f32(-Pi, Pi);</span>
<span>auto rot   = exp(Quat{0, 1, 0, 0} * angle / 2);</span>
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
You also have to divide the angle by 2, because the Quaternion rotation rotates by twice the encoded angle.
        </p>
        <p>
As the example shows, the angle is given in radians, in this case rotating somewhere between a quarter turn in either direction on the <code>YZ</code> plane.
While <code>exp</code> on Complex Numbers is somewhat well known due to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity">Euler's identity</a>, shockingly few implementations of Quaternions I found have definitions for it.
So let's quickly go over it here:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
Math:
  q = a + b<b>e<sub>yz</sub></b> + c<b>e<sub>zx</sub></b> + d<b>e<sub>xy</sub></b>
  θ = |b<b>e<sub>yz</sub></b> + c<b>e<sub>zx</sub></b> + d<b>e<sub>xy</sub></b>|

  e<sup>q</sup> = e<sup>a</sup>(cos(θ) +
          sin(θ) * (b<b>e<sub>yz</sub></b> + c<b>e<sub>zx</sub></b> + d<b>e<sub>xy</sub></b>)/θ)

Code:
<span>Quaternion exp(Quaternion q) {</span>
<span>  auto e = exp(q.cs);</span>
<span>  auto theta = sqrt(square(q.c23) + square(q.c31) + square(q.c12));</span>
<span>  auto s = e * sin(theta) / theta;</span>
<span>  return {</span>
<span>    .cs  = e * cos(theta),</span>
<span>    .c23 = s * q.c23,</span>
<span>    .c31 = s * q.c31,</span>
<span>    .c12 = s * q.c12</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>}</span>
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
While I'm not going to prove this here, you can see that it will work as expected for Real Numbers, where <code>θ</code> is 0, as well as for Complex Numbers, where <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are 0.
        </p>
        <p>
Okay, but the title says that we're not using radians, while the <code>exp</code> function clearly does, what gives?
For us to abandon radians, we have to look a little further, at the <code>pow</code> function.
It is defined like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
q<sup>a</sup> = exp(log(q) * a)
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
So now we also need the Quaternion logarithm, great.
But before that, let's think about what we should expect from the <code>pow</code> function.
A unit Bi-vector like <code><b>e<sub>xy</sub></b></code> is the result of multiplying the two unit-vectors <code><b>e<sub>x</sub></b></code> and <code><b>e<sub>y</sub></b></code> together, which are perpendicular to each other, which makes a quarter turn.
The Quaternion rotation always rotates by twice the angle that is encoded in the Quaternion, so we get a half-turn.
Taking a Quaternion as-is is the same as taking <code>q<sup>1</sup></code> and doing no rotation, which would just be <code>1</code>, can be achieved with <code>q<sup>0</sup></code>.
And <code>q<sup>0.5</sup></code> should be the same as <code>√q</code> which I've written about <a target="_blank" href="0009.html">before</a> and halves the rotation.
So we can use the <code>pow</code> function between 0 and 1 to linearly interpolate between a 0° and 180° turn, and of course from 1 to 2 to get the rest of the circle.
What we won't need anymore is to put <code>π</code> in our calculation, yay!
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
<span>auto turn = random_f32(-0.5f, 0.5f);</span>
<span>auto rot  = pow(Quat{0, 1, 0, 0}, turn);</span>
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
But now let's bite the bullet, what's the logarithm of a Quaternion?
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
Math:
  q = a + b<b>e<sub>yz</sub></b> + c<b>e<sub>zx</sub></b> + d<b>e<sub>xy</sub></b>
  θ = |b<b>e<sub>yz</sub></b> + c<b>e<sub>zx</sub></b> + d<b>e<sub>xy</sub></b>|

  log(q) = log(|q|) +
           acos(a / |q|) * (b<b>e<sub>yz</sub></b> + c<b>e<sub>zx</sub></b> + d<b>e<sub>xy</sub></b>)/θ

Code:
<span>Quaternion log(Quaternion q) {</span>
<span>  auto theta = sqrt(square(q.c23) + square(q.c31) + square(q.c12));</span>
<span>  auto norm = abs(q);</span>
<span>  auto a = acos(q.cs / norm) / theta;</span>
<span>  return {</span>
<span>    .cs  = log(norm),</span>
<span>    .c23 = a * q.c23,</span>
<span>    .c31 = a * q.c31,</span>
<span>    .c12 = a * q.c12</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>}</span>
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
In both code snippets I've left out handling of zero-divisions, but you can already see, those are some chonkers.
And we're supposed call both of these functions whenever we want to rotate something?
Not quite: only when we want to rotate on a certain plane around a certain amount, which at least to me happens quite infrequently.
Otherwise we can just use the <a target="_blank" href="0009.html">Vector-Vector product</a> to turn from one to the other.
And one pore point: since <code>exp</code> and <code>log</code> are inverse functions of each other, we might be able to cancel out a bunch of stuff if we inline them.
While there are already very few Quaternion implementations that have <code>log</code> and <code>exp</code> functions, even fewer have <code>pow</code>.
Only one I found didn't implement <code>pow</code> in by calling <code>exp(log(q)*e)</code> and that one had a bug.
So here's my hopefully less-buggy version, I don't know it it could be improved further.
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
<span>Quaternion pow(Quaternion q, float e) {</span>
<span>  auto theta_square = square(q.c23) + square(q.c31) + square(q.c12);</span>
<span>  auto norm = sqrt(square(q.cs) + theta_square);</span>
<span>  auto p = pow(norm, e);</span>
<span>  auto a = e * acos(q.cs / norm);</span>
<span>  auto s = p / sqrt(theta_square) * sin(a);</span>
<span>  return {</span>
<span>    .cs  = p * cos(a),</span>
<span>    .c23 = s * q.c23,</span>
<span>    .c31 = s * q.c31,</span>
<span>    .c12 = s * q.c12</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>}</span>
          </pre>
        </code>
