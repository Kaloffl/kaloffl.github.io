        <p>
In the <a target="_blank" href="0012.html">previous article</a> I wrote about the two major conventions for implementing Quaternions and how they were actually the same when viewed through the lens of geometric algebra.
This time I want to hammer that point home with another example.
        </p>
        <p>
But before that, a shout-out to this great paper:
<a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02508">Quaternion kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter</a> by Joan Sol√†.
About a third of this paper just talks about Quaternions, their properties, operations on and with them, it's great!
One of the chapters also talks about the different conventions and that there are more than just Hamiltonian and JPL.

        <h3>What's affected?</h3>
        <p>
All this talk about conventions and handedness, but which operations will actually produce different results when another convention is used?
Spoilers for the end of the article: none.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves, there are <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Matrix/issues/28">issues</a> on Github talking about different implementations of the Quaternion multiplication.
So clearly when the multiplication changes, operations base on it, like Quaternion division and the vector rotation, will also change.
Multiplying vectors together to get a Quaternion is also affected, since the resulting Quaternion has to contain different coefficients depending on the convention.
In particular its asymmetric part, the outer product, changes.
        </p>
        <p>
There are a bunch of operations that are not affected by conventions:
the simple addition and subtraction, although seldom used, will just keep doing their thing.
Scalar multiplication and division stay the same.
Taking the quadrature, length or norm of a Quaternion is also unaffected.
Interestingly despite the changing multiplication, squaring a Quaternion will not change between conventions, the same is true for taking its square root. 
And finally operations like <code>exp</code>, <code>log</code> and <code>pow</code> remain the same.

        <h3>A closer look</h3>
        <p>
Let's look at the two multiplications mentions in the issue I linked above.
I've changed from their index-based code to using subscripts.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
r = p * q

Hamilton:
r<sub>s</sub> = p<sub>s</sub> * q<sub>s</sub> - p<sub>i</sub> * q<sub>i</sub> - p<sub>j</sub> * q<sub>j</sub> - p<sub>k</sub> * q<sub>k</sub>; 
r<sub>i</sub> = p<sub>s</sub> * q<sub>i</sub> + p<sub>i</sub> * q<sub>s</sub> + p<sub>j</sub> * q<sub>k</sub> - p<sub>k</sub> * q<sub>j</sub>; 
r<sub>j</sub> = p<sub>s</sub> * q<sub>j</sub> - p<sub>i</sub> * q<sub>k</sub> + p<sub>j</sub> * q<sub>s</sub> + p<sub>k</sub> * q<sub>i</sub>; 
r<sub>k</sub> = p<sub>s</sub> * q<sub>k</sub> + p<sub>i</sub> * q<sub>j</sub> - p<sub>j</sub> * q<sub>i</sub> + p<sub>k</sub> * q<sub>s</sub>;


Non-Hamilton (Hamilnot?):
r<sub>s</sub> = p<sub>s</sub> * q<sub>s</sub> - p<sub>i</sub> * q<sub>i</sub> - p<sub>j</sub> * q<sub>j</sub> - p<sub>k</sub> * q<sub>k</sub>;
r<sub>i</sub> = p<sub>s</sub> * q<sub>i</sub> + p<sub>i</sub> * q<sub>s</sub> - p<sub>j</sub> * q<sub>k</sub> + p<sub>k</sub> * q<sub>j</sub>;
r<sub>j</sub> = p<sub>s</sub> * q<sub>j</sub> + p<sub>i</sub> * q<sub>k</sub> + p<sub>j</sub> * q<sub>s</sub> - p<sub>k</sub> * q<sub>i</sub>;
r<sub>k</sub> = p<sub>s</sub> * q<sub>k</sub> - p<sub>i</sub> * q<sub>j</sub> + p<sub>j</sub> * q<sub>i</sub> + p<sub>k</sub> * q<sub>s</sub>;
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
When staring at these two formulations long enough (or when looking at the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Matrix/commit/19554c4470cd6322ffd18cb20a96485940f226b6?diff=split#diff-e6ff1cd48fcdade4c4e02cf799c912b9de2a2ffdaf8e8390c9d3a50c156625e6L190">diff</a>), we might notice that the only changes are sign flips.
In fact, the sign changes are only in relation to <code>j</code>, which leads me to conclude that <code>j<sub>Hamilton</sub> = -j<sub>not-Hamilton</sub></code>. 
        </p>
        <p>
Where have we seen that before?
Right, it's our friend <code>e<sub>13</sub></code> vs <code>e<sub>31</sub></code> again.
Because the Quaternion "vector part" is actually made of three bi-vectors like <code>e<sub>12</sub></code>, <code>e<sub>23</sub></code> and <code>e<sub>31</sub></code>.
The subscript numbers say from which two basis vectors these basis bi-vectors are made.
And if we swap the order of these numbers in the subscript, we have to add a minus in the front: <code>e<sub>31</sub> = -e<sub>13</sub></code>.
I won't go into why that is here, but it's one of the fundamental rules of geometric algebra.
        </p>
        <p>
Given all this, the two implementations above are mathematically equivalent.
It's just that one has defined <code>j</code> as <code>e<sub>31</sub></code> and the other as <code>e<sub>13</sub></code>.
So really the question is not "How is your multiplication defined?" but instead "How is your representation defined?".
        </p>
        <p>
Because the whole issue seems to arise from the differing definitions of <code>j</code>, the lesson for me here is that you shouldn't use the names <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> as they don't carry all the information we need.
If you don't like <code>e<sub>12</sub></code>, you could instead use <code>xy</code>, <code>yz</code>, <code>zx</code>, which also display the order you've chosen.
Although this won't help us communicating whether we've chosen <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> to be a left-handed or right-handed basis to begin with.
