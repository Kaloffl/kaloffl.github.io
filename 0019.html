Quadratic Bezier curves are probably the most popular curves in computer graphics.
You're seeing them right now in the text you're reading, because TrueType fonts use them to describe the shape of the font glyphs.
Cubic Bezier curves are also popular, but computationally and mathematically more difficult.

        </p>
        <p>
The simplest way to draw these curves is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casteljau%27s_algorithm" target="_blank">De Casteljau's algorithm</a>, but it's also not very practical.
Another option is to turn the curve into a series of sufficiently small triangles and let the GPU render them.
The option we're looking at in this article is to find a mathematical formula that for any pixel position gives us the distance to the nearest point on the curve.
It's not the most efficient solution but gives us a lot of flexibility: a pixel shader on the GPU could just evaluate this formula for every pixel in parallel, compare the distance to a threshold that dictates the line thickness and then draw the result.
On the CPU we could write a tree-like algorithm that can use the distance to quickly discard areas where the curve can't be.
Distance functions like these are also easily combined with other distance functions by use of the <code>min(a, b)</code> function.
Check out <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/" target="_blank">Inigo Quilez</a>' website for many more examples.

        <h3>The formula</h3>
        <p>
Okay, we want the distance from any point towards the nearest point on the curve.
Finding the distance is pretty easy thanks to Pythagoras, so we only need to care about finding the nearest point.
Let's call the point for which we want to know this distance <code>p</code> and the nearest point on the parabola <code>n</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
A quadratic Bezier curve is really just a slice of a parabola, so to make things even easier, we can transform both the curve and point so that the parabola is simply <code>y=x<sup>2</sup></code>.
This formula also shows that we don't even need to find the nearest point, but just the <code>x</code>-position of it, because the <code>y</code> part is easily computed.
How this transformation is done we'll take a look at later.
        </p>
        <p>
But a Bezier curve is only a slice of a parabola, so if we find the nearest point of a full parabola, the point may be off the end!
Fear not, we can also compute the smallest and largest allowed value of <code>x</code> and just clamp to that, again, we'll see how to do this later.
        </p>
        <p>
The key insight to find the closest point is to realize, that a line through our point <code>p</code> and the closest point <code>n</code> on the parabola will be normal to the parabola, in other words perpendicular to the tangent at the closest point.
After <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/q7mhhqvrvt" target="_blank">some finagling with a graphing tool</a>, you'll find the formula for such a line is <code>y = 0.5 - x/(2n<sub>x</sub>) + n<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></code> where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are defining the line and <code>n<sub>x</sub></code> is the x-position on the parabola we want the normal for.
        </p>
        <p>
But we don't know the value of <code>n<sub>x</sub></code>, if we knew that we would already be done!
True, but here's something we know: values for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
Because the line has to go through <code>p</code>, the values <code>p<sub>x</sub></code> and <code>p<sub>y</sub></code> can be inserted into the equation.
That leaves us with only one unknown variable: <code>n<sub>x</sub></code> for which we have to solve.
        </p>
      </section>
      <figure>
        <pre>
  p<sub>y</sub> = 0.5 - p<sub>x</sub>/(2n<sub>x</sub>) + n<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>       | * n<sub>x</sub>
p<sub>y</sub>n<sub>x</sub> = 0.5n<sub>x</sub> - p<sub>x</sub>/2 + n<sub>x</sub><sup>3</sup>         | - p<sub>y</sub>n<sub>x</sub>
   0 = 0.5n<sub>x</sub> - p<sub>x</sub>/2 + n<sub>x</sub><sup>3</sup> - p<sub>y</sub>n<sub>x</sub>
     = n<sub>x</sub><sup>3</sup> + (0.5 - p<sub>y</sub>)n<sub>x</sub> - p<sub>x</sub>/2
        </pre>

Oh no, it's a cubic polynomial.
Well at least we're not dealing with ellipsis, those have quartic polynomial.
And a way for cubic root-finding was discovered about 500 years ago by Italian mathematicians, together with the beginnings of imaginary numbers, so it must be good.
        </p>
        <p>
First, we have to make the polynomial depressed, which is a weird way of saying that it shouldn't have a quadratic part and the cubic coefficient has to e 1.
While there is a way to turn any cubic into that shape, we don't have to worry about it, because our polynomial is already depressed.
Yay.
That leaves only two numbers to worry about: the linear and scalar coefficients.
Let's call them <code>l = 0.5-p<sub>y</sub></code> and <code>s = -p<sub>x</sub>/2</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
The next step is to calculate a discriminant value, for which Wikipedia confusingly has multiple definitions.
Let's go with <code>d = l<sup>3</sup>/27 + s<sup>2</sup>/4</code>.
If <code>d</code> is negative, there will be three roots, if it's positive, there is one real root, and if it's zero, some of the roots overlap and there are one or two roots.
        </p>
        <p>
For the case of one root Wikipedia gives us this rootful formula: <code>r<sub>0</sub> = ∛(√(d) + s/2) + ∛(√(d) - s/2)</code> which has a nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation#Cardano's_method" targetg="_blank">derivation</a>.
And understanding that derivation turned out quite helpful for solving a problematic case of <i>catastrophic cancellation</i>, which plagues almost all code that employs the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula" target="_blank">Quadratic formula</a> for root finding.
        </p>
        <p>
As one does, I was just reading <i>What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic</i> where the Quadratic formula <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html#700">was used as an example</a> to show how to avoid such cancellation.
I also found <a href="https://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/math/2020/01/10/Quadratic.html" target="_blank">this blog-post</a> which also suggests the use of <code>fma</code> to calculate the determinant.
        </p>
        <p>
If the discriminant is negative, there will be three roots, corresponding to three possible perpendicular lines through the parabola and <code>p</code>.
<a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MdXBzB" target="_blank">This demonstration</a> shows, however, that only two of those lines could ever be the closest, so we don't have to compute one of the roots.
        </p>
        <p>
Following a trigonometric solution, the three roots can be computed by:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
u = 2√(-l/3)
r<sub>i</sub> = u*cos((acos(3s/(lu)) - 2πi)/3)
          </pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
Where <code>i</code> is <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> for the three possible roots.
As mentioned before, we can leave out one which turns out to always be <code>1</code>.
Now with a way of finding all the roots, we can finally compute the distance.
In a case with multiple roots, we can simply compute both distances and pick the smaller one.
In code it might look like this:
        </p>
      </section>
      <figure>
        <pre>
float l = 0.5 - p.y;
float s = -0.5 * p.x;

float e = -(l * l * l / 27.0);
float discriminant = fma(s, s, -4.0 * e);

if (0.0 <= discriminant)
{
  // one root
  float f = (-s + sign(p.x) * sqrt(discriminant)) * 0.5;
  float qx = clamp(cbrt(f) + cbrt(e / f), min_x, max_x);
  return hypot(qx - p.x, qx * qx - p.y) / scale;
}
// three roots
// However, the center one can never be the closest, so we can ignore it.
float r3p = sqrt(p.y - 0.5) * (2.0 / sqrt(3.0));
float ac  = acos(3.0 * s / (l * r3p)) / 3.0;
float qx0 = clamp(r3p * cos(ac                 ), min_x, max_x);
float qx1 = clamp(r3p * cos(ac - 4.0 * Pi / 3.0), min_x, max_x);
return min(
    hypot(qx0 - p.x, qx0 * qx0 - p.y),
    hypot(qx1 - p.x, qx1 * qx1 - p.y)) / scale;
        </pre>
      </figure>

        <h3>The rest</h3>
        <p>
All that's left now is a way of turning three points into a parabola, finding the transformation that turns this parabola into the unit parabola, and finding the lower and upper bound of <code>x</code> on this parabola that correspond with the start and end point of the curve.
Easy.
Well, in terms of code it isn't that much, but I have to admit that I wrote this code 5 years ago and it took me a while to figure it out again.
        </p>
      </section>
      <figure>
        <pre>
vec2  ny     = normalize(a - 2.0 * b + c);
vec2  nx     = vec2(ny.y, -ny.x);
float xa     = dot(a - b, ny) / dot(a - b, nx) / 2.0;
float xc     = dot(c - b, ny) / dot(c - b, nx) / 2.0;
float scale  = (xa - xc) / dot(a - c, nx);
vec2  vertex = a - nx * (xa / scale) - ny * (xa * xa / scale);
float min_x  = min(xa, xc);
float max_x  = max(xa, xc);

vec2  p = (g - vertex) * mat2(nx, ny) * scale;
        </pre>
      </figure>

        <p>
Starting out with <code>ny</code> and <code>nx</code> which are the basis-vectors of the coordinate-system in which our unit-parabola will exist.
We'll need them to transform any query point <code>g</code> into the point <code>p</code> we talked about previously.
The formula <code>a - 2.0 * b + c</code> takes <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> and computes the direction from <code>b</code> to a fourth point that completes a parallelogram.
I have no idea why, but the y-axis of the parabola of a quadratic Bezier is always aligned to this direction.
        </p>
        <p>
The values <code>xa</code> and <code>xc</code> are the x-values of the parabola at the locations of the endpoints <code>a</code> and <code>c</code>.
Together they're used to compute the <code>scale</code> of the parabola by dividing the x-distance on the parabola <code>xa - xc</code> by the distance on screen along the x-axis <code>dot(a - c, nx)</code>.
The values <code>xa</code> and <code>xc</code> are the bounds of the curve on the parabola, but we need to sort them properly into lower and upper bound for <code>clamp</code> to work, that's what <code>min_x</code> and <code>max_x</code> are for.
        </p>
        <p>
The <code>vertex</code> is then computed by starting at point <code>a</code> and moving <code>-xa</code> units along the x-axis and <code>-xa<sup>2</sup></code> units along the y-axis.
There are more direct ways to compute the <code>vertex</code> without <code>xa</code> or even <code>nx</code> and <code>ny</code>, but since they are already here, this way is quicker.
        </p>
        <p>
Finally, the transformation of the screen-coordinate <code>g</code> into the unit-parabola coordinate <code>p</code>.
This is done by moving the vertex to the origin with a subtraction followed by a rotation to align the parabola along the y axis.
I'm using a matrix made of the basis-vectors for the rotation here because it's shorter, but it's just a few multiplications and additions.
        </p>
        <p>
And that's my slightly convoluted way to compute the distance to a quadratic Bezier curve.
A lot of the second part might not be necessary and could be inlined into the first by relaxing some of the assumptions about the parabola.
But I like this division because it allows us to pre-compute everything we can about the curve before doing more efficient distance queries later.
