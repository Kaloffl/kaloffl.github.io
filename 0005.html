In the <a target="_blank" href="0004.html">previous post</a> we explored and fix an unfortunate bug in the game <a target="_blank" href="https://www.introversion.co.uk/scannersombre/">Scanner Sombre</a>.
And while I got the game running again, the question remained: why did it stop working in the first place?
        </p>
        <p>
So far we uncovered, that the game tries to run code that appears to be flat-out broken, which means that this code wasn't executed in the past.
There are countless possible explanations for this, but we can narrow it down due to an observation I made last time:
the code executed a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1" target="_blank">SHA1</a> related instructions.
However, SHA1 instructions were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_SHA_extensions" target="_blank">just becoming available</a> in 2017 when the game was released, in Intel's Goldmont and AMD's ZEN architecture.
On Intel's Core line it took even longer, until Sunny Cove in late 2019, for the SHA1 extension to arrive.
        </p>
        <p>
All this is to say:
the game must have a fall-back strategy in case the CPU isn't capable of these relatively new instructions.
This would explain, why I had no problem running it in the past, before I upgraded from a Sky-Lake to an Ice-Lake CPU.
It doesn't explain why the developers chose to deploy a ticking time-bomb of untested and broken code, when a perfectly functioning code path already exists.
I'll come back to that later, but I'll say this much: it's not directly Introversion's fault.
        </p>
        <p>
Now that we have a theory of why the game worked in the past, let's go and test it.
If what I wrote is true, we should be able to go up the call-stack from our crashy SHA1 function and find the place that decides to call this instead of some other function.
And because I didn't show it last time, here's how the stack should look like when we don't accidentally mangle the <code>rsp</code> register:

So where do we land when we go up one frame, to address <code>00007FF7D50F67EF</code>?
There should be a <code>call</code> to out function at <code>00007FF7D515FD00</code> there.
Lets see...

Okay, since we followed the return address, we have to look at the instruction before that, which is indeed a <code>call</code>.
But for some reason, it's a <code>call</code> to a different address, what's up with that?
My best guess is that the compiler did a tail-call optimization at this point.
The function we see getting called here, let's call it Dirk, will at some point call the SHA1 function.
But once the SHA1 function returns, Dirk has nothing to do and will immediately return as well.
In such a case, the compiler might not put a <code>call</code> instruction into Dirk, but instead opt for a jump.
The difference being, that <code>call</code> pushes the return address on the stack.
If Dirk has left nothing on the stack when the jump is executed, it will seem from the SHA1 function's point of view, as if Dirk's caller had called it directly.
        </p>
        <p>
Great, another theory, even though we haven't even verified the fist one.
Let's take a look at this Dirk fella.

Looks like the function starts out with the usual prolog of saving some registers onto the stack and <code>mov</code>ing registers around.
What's more interesting are the <code>test</code> instructions, followed by conditional jumps (<code>je</code> and <code>jne</code>).
One of those jumps comes pretty close to the address we expected, but 22 (16<sub>hex</sub>) bytes after the start of the function.
This isn't too surprising if we continue with the tail-call assumption:
Dirk has already executed a bunch of <code>mov</code> instructions that the SHA1 function would also do at the start, so the jump skips right past them.
        </p>
        <p>
All those instructions after the <code>jne</code> will not be executed, because the SHA1 function won't return here, as we've seen from the call stack.
In fact, we can also assume that the jump above wasn't taken, because it's also wouldn't have returned here.
Which jump does or doesn't get executed is being controlled with those <code>test</code> and <code>cmp</code> instructions.
Those set the zero- and carry-flags, which will then be used by the <code>je, jne, jgt, ...</code> instructions to decide weather to jump or not.
        </p>
        <p>
But what are they testing?
In the case of our <code>jne</code> the <code>test</code> instruction checks if bit 29 in <code>r10d</code> (<code>r10</code>'s lower 32 bit) is set.
Looking a few instructions above, we see <code>r10d</code> being assigned a value from memory location <code>7FF7D5B91BB8<sub>hex</sub></code>.
This location happens to lie in the <code>.data</code> segment of the executable, which means it is a global variable with read and write access.
Taking a peek at this memory location (and keeping in mind how little-endian works) we see that indeed bit 29 of that value is set:

Recalling the theory from before, that the game selects a code-path based on available CPU-features, this is probably a bunch of flags describing said features.
That would also explain why this is a run-time check and why this global variable is in writable memory:
because the flags are queried at runtime and written here for functions like Dirk to read.
But if Dirk just does the reading, who did the writing?
        </p>
        <p>
This is quickly answered by placing a memory-write breakpoint at this address and re-running the game for the billionth time.
And just like that, we caught the culprit read-handed:

This is more like it.
Stepping through the code and watching the memory location I can see that it is exactly this <code>mov</code> that is writing the values we observed earlier.
And from the instructions above we see what is being stored:
the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/cpuid" target="_blank"><code>cpuid</code> instruction</a> stores information about supported CPU features in the <code>eax, ebx, ecx, edx</code> registers.
Apparently, we're only interested in the <code>ebx</code> part, as that is the only one being committed to memory.
Now with four times 32 bits you might think that is enough bits, but no!
There are multiple sets of flags that can be returned by <code>cpuid</code> and you have to set <code>eax</code> and <code>ecx</code> to select which one you want to get.
In our case, <code>eax</code> is set to 7 while <code>ecx</code> is cleared to 0.
And what does <code>cpuid</code> store in bit 29 of <code>ebx</code> with those values set?
Here it is:
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
Who'd've thunk it!
This now gives us a full picture of why the faulty code wasn't executed in the past, and is now offering quite a different kind of entertainment than I expected when I came back to this game.
Unfortunately I don't think there is an easy way to hide CPU features from a program, so anyone with a SHA1-instruction-capable CPU will unfortunately have to patch the executable to get it running again.

        <h3>Who do we blame?!</h3>
        <p>
Now that we answered the what, why, how and when, it is time to answer the final question: who.
As it is programming tradition, that we only deliver the highest quality of software or face the consequences of our actions.
and somebody clearly has some facing of consequences to do here!
        </p>
        <p>
But with all the code statically linked into a single binary with no symbols to divulge this crucial information, what can we do?
Well, my programmer-intuition tells me that it is unlikely that Introversion Software would have spent the time writing code using instructions so new that they might not even had hardware capable of running them at launch.
It could have been an over-enthusiastic library author, or even more likely: the engine they used: Unity.
        </p>
        <p>
Luckily I just happened to have another game from around that time that also used the Unity game engine: Hollow Knight.
So I downloaded that and started debugging.
This time the executable was a lot smaller, with most of the code being stored in a separate dll: <code>UnityPlayer.dll</code>.
And after some digging, I found a chunk of code that looked almost exactly the same.
I say almost, because this time it actually works correctly.
Here's the comparison:

Did you spot the difference?
Gr8!
And so we have reached the conclusion our little adventure.
We can blame Unity for including the faulty code in their engine in at least one very specific version back in 2017.
It is still unclear weather they wrote it themselves or used a third-party library.
After a quick search for public SHA1 code using these instructions, I couldn't find anything that definitely matched this assembly.
So the jury is still out on this one.
Tune in for the next crusade, when some other software doesn't work!

        <h3>Addendum</h3>
        <p>
Ladies and Gentlemen, we've got him!
Thanks to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/475190/discussions/0/2999920878441544387/?tscn=1650969565#c3274689286970646480" target="_blank">a tip on the steam discussions</a> I found the source of the broken code and can finally rest easy again at night.
The tip was to set some environment variables to disable certain OpenSSL features.
It makes sense that OpenSSL would contain hashing functions, and since it is a widely used library, making these functions as efficient as possible by using hardware specific features is certainly a noble act.
The way they do it in this case is with a lot of handwritten Assembler code, slightly enhanced with some Pearl as a kind of macro language.
And <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/619b94667cc7a097f6d1e2123c4f4c2c85afb8f7/crypto/sha/asm/sha1-x86_64.pl#L367" target="_blank">this handwritten Assembly</a> does indeed contain the erroneous code.
It was introduces in 2014, and then <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7123aa81e9fb19afb11fdf3850662c5f7ff1f19c" target="_blank">fixed</a> in 2016 with the mention of "a crash in SHAEXT code on Windows".
I'm not entirely sure that this code would have worked on Linux, but the <code>rax</code> register seems to have a slightly different role between platforms, so it's plausible.
