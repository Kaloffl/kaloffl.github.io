<a href="0002.html">Last we left off</a>, we had a way to check if two line segments intersect, but other questions like *where* they intersect were left open.
To get to that answer, we'll first take a closer look at what I wrote at the end of the last article: the Minkowski Difference.
        </p>

        <h3>line - line = parallelogram</h3>
        <p>
The quick introduction to Minkowski Differences is this: for every point in shape A take every point in shape B and subtract it.
The set of all resulting points is the Minkowski Difference.
In theory, we have infinitely many points that lie on our two line segments, but luckily we only have to use the endpoints and can imagine a convex hull around the four resulting points.

        </figure>
        <p>
This almost looks like what we had last time, but with two differences:
First, some points seem to have been turned around: D is on top, C at the bottom, which is to be expected since we used subtraction instead of addition this time (and last time I hat to fiddle with the signs to make it work in the first place).
Second, the Origin is not on one of the corners anymore, but instead somewhere inside the shape.
Though we can be a bit more specific than 'somewhere': the location of the Origin in relation to the shape tells us if and where the line segments intersect.
If the Origin is outside of the parallelogram, the segments don't touch.
If it is inside the shape and close to A-C, then the intersection of the lines is close to the points A and C, and so on. 
This is a general property of Minkowski Differences, in any number of dimensions, not just two.
This is also how a much more advanced collision-detection algorithm works: the Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi algorithm.
But luckily for us, when we deal with just two lines in 2D, we don't need a fancy iterative algorithm to locate the Origin, we just need a little math.

        </figure>
        <p>
To locate the Origin relative to the parallelogram, we can use two numbers: how far along the B-A direction and how far along the D-C direction to go from the A-C corner?
Let's call the first distance s and the second one t.
If we have those two distances, it will also be trivial to check if the Origin lies in- or outside of the parallelogram: just check 0 <= s and s <= ||B-A|| and the equivalent for t.
Getting the real intersection point is also easy now, you can just start at point A and go s units along in the direction of B.
        </p>
        <p>
Getting those two distances is not quite as trivial on first glance.
And while I've already spoiled the solution in the previous post, let's take this opportunity to try and solve it with PGA again.
Let's take stock what we have: the four corners of the parallelogram, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, as well as the Origin.
Because these are differences between points, It would seem appropriate to consider them directions in PGA, with the e<sub>12</sub> part being zero.
But at least the approach that I chose views these corners as points with the notation shown in listing 0.
        </p>

          <pre>
Point A-C  =  ac<sub>20</sub> * e<sub>20</sub> + ac<sub>01</sub> * e<sub>01</sub> + e<sub>12</sub>
Point A-D  =  ad<sub>20</sub> * e<sub>20</sub> + ad<sub>01</sub> * e<sub>01</sub> + e<sub>12</sub>
Point B-C  =  bc<sub>20</sub> * e<sub>20</sub> + bc<sub>01</sub> * e<sub>01</sub> + e<sub>12</sub>
Point B-D  =  bd<sub>20</sub> * e<sub>20</sub> + bd<sub>01</sub> * e<sub>01</sub> + e<sub>12</sub>
(note: ac<sub>12</sub> = ad<sub>12</sub> = bc<sub>12</sub> = bd<sub>12</sub> = 1)
          </pre>
          <figcaption>Listing 0: Notation for the corners of the parallelogram</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
The strategy I came up with to find s and t uses the fact, that it is easy in PGA to get the area of a parallelogram: just join three points together.
The first join creates a line through the first two points, the second one joins the line and third point into the area as a single scalar value.
By creating an area from A-C, A-D and the Origin, we get how much is "on the A side" of the Origin.
Divide that through the area of the whole parallelogram and you get a number that is 0 if the intersection happens directly on point A, 1 if it happens on B and so on.
Do the same for the A-C, B-C, Origin area and you have both the s and t numbers we were looking for.
If both are between 0 and 1, we not only know that there was an intersection, but also where.

Now let's go through the actual calculations, instead of just hand-waving some abstract operations.
For reference, listing 1 shows the full join operation between two multivectors, which I took form the sourcecode avaiable on bivector.net [1].
I'm still looking for a way to derive it myself from the geometric product.

Well that got a lot shorter!
And by merging ad-ac into cd it got even shorter.
I also shuffled around the differences used in l<sub>0</sub> to use cd instead of ad.
The same can be done for m, so that it uses A-B and A-C.
Now onto joining the lines and points.

As expected, joining l and B-C reduced down to a single scalar value with a nice and easy equation.
Even smaller are the equations for i and j, because they are joined with the Origin, where even more terms are zero.
But it turns out, h can be just as small, if we inline and refactor the expressions of l.

So now that calculation is also really short, and as a bonus we don't need l<sub>1</sub> and l<sub>2</sub> anymore.
Also, we didn't need m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> in the first place.

        <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
        <p>
So now that we have the exact calculations we need, we can put it all together into a function that calculate the point of intersection between two line segments.
        </p>
        <figure id="listing6">
          <pre>
inline int line_line_intersection(
  Vec2 a, Vec2 b, // line 0
  Vec2 c, Vec2 d, // line 1
  Vec2 *result)
{
  auto ab_01 = a.x - b.x;
  auto ab_20 = a.y - b.y;
  auto cd_01 = c.x - d.x;
  auto cd_20 = c.y - d.y;
  auto ac_01 = a.x - c.x;
  auto ac_20 = a.y - c.y;

  auto h = cd_20 * ab_01 - cd_01 * ab_20;
  auto i = cd_20 * ac_01 - cd_01 * ac_20;
  auto j = ab_20 * ac_01 - ab_01 * ac_20;

  auto s = i / h;
  auto t = j / h;
  if (0.0f <= s && s <= 1.0f && 0.0f <= t && t <= 1.0f)
  {
    if (result)
    {
      *result = lerp(a, b, s);
    }
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
          </pre>
          <figcaption>Listing 6: The C++ code resulting from the calculations above</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
And here we effectively have the original code, so that's nice.
Though the way to get there was quite complicated, so I'm sure there is a faster way to come up with this.
But the good news is that all the steps were just simple formula manipulations, so it was also quite simple from that perspective.
But my guess is, that starting from the Minkowski Difference, is not ideal and there is a faster way to derive these formulas.
So a part 3 maybe?
We'll see.
